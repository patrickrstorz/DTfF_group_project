### Some info about PMI
- Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) is a survey that measures firms' business activity.
- The surveys ask respondents (managers) to report the change in each variable (like output or employment) compared to the prior month, noting whether each has risen/improved, fallen/deteriorated or remained unchanged.
- Flash reading is an advanced estimate of the final PMI number based on ~85% of total responses. It's publised about a week earlier
- PMIs are calculated by using diffusion index: INDEX = %’higher’ * 1.0 + %’the same’ * 0.5 + %’lower’ * 0.0.
- If PMI is 50 then nothing changed with respect to the last month. More than 50 - increased business activity. Less than 50 - decreased activity.
- PMIs can be used to forecast GDP
